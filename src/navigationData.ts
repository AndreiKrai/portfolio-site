    projectReview:"The main task was to develop and deliver a secure messenger application built entirely from scratch. The app was designed to prioritize user data privacy by ensuring that no data is stored in the cloud. Instead, all data resides securely on the user's device, with the capability to export it as an encrypted file for transfer to another device. To maintain a high level of security, all data within the app is fully encrypted, and we implemented custom messaging logic without utilizing any third-party messaging libraries. This approach allowed us to ensure complete control over the messaging system's security and functionality. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was completed and successfully launched on both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, marking a significant milestone in the project's development."
